# Context Mode Configuration
# =============================================================================
# CONTEXT_MODE controls how course materials are provided to the AI:
#   - rag: Use OpenAI Vector Store for semantic search (requires VECTOR_STORE_ID)
#   - full: Load ALL course materials into context (ignores FILE_PATTERNS)
#   - filtered: Load only files matching FILE_PATTERNS into context
# Default: rag if VECTOR_STORE_ID is set, otherwise filtered

# AI Command Tools
# =============================================================================
# Enable AI-powered command handling (week focus, reset, help)
# When enabled, the AI can understand natural language commands like:
#   - "Focus on week 3" / "Let's study week 5"
#   - "Show all weeks" / "Cover everything"
#   - "Start over" / "New conversation"
#   - "Help" / "What can you do?"
# Set to false to disable these tools and reduce token usage slightly

# Access Control: Restrict bot to specific streams and their members
# Comma-separated list of stream names
# Only users subscribed to these streams can use the bot (in stream or via DM)
# Leave empty or remove to allow access from anywhere
